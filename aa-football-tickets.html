            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Please do not order on speculation. The AA purchases tickets from the Athletic Department based on our count and the orders you place with us.  While we may be able to find a replacement buyer for your tickets, a failure to sell the tickets in our allotment can result in future limits on the ability of our local clubs to order tickets.  Thanks in advance for your anticipated cooperation.</p>
